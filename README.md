# Analyzing-water-quality-dataset
This project analyzes water quality data to assess parameters like pH, hardness, and conductivity, focusing on water potability and sustainable access. Using Kaggle data, it identifies contaminants and pollution trends. Then machine learning and visualization tools like Python and Power BI are used to enhance public awareness and support SDG 6.


# Problem Statement
Many communities still face challenges with water quality, which poses health risks and hinders sustainable development. Contaminants in water are impacting its potability, making safe drinking water scarce. Addressing these issues requires analyzing water quality data and implementing targeted interventions to improve water treatment, mitigate health risks, and contribute to achieving SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

# About Project

In this project, I worked with a dataset on water quality to predict whether water is potable or not. First, I cleaned the data by handling any missing values, filling them in with the median to avoid bias. Then, I normalized the data to ensure the models perform optimally. I tested multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to make accurate predictions. To better understand the data, I also created visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots, which helped in analyzing the relationships between different features. This approach enabled me to build a reliable model to predict water potability.
