# Analyzing-water-quality-dataset
This project analyzes water quality data to assess parameters like pH, hardness, and conductivity, focusing on water potability and sustainable access. Using Kaggle data, it identifies contaminants and pollution trends. Then machine learning and visualization tools like Python and Power BI are used to enhance public awareness and support SDG 6.


# Problem Statement
Many communities still face challenges with water quality, which poses health risks and hinders sustainable development. Contaminants in water are impacting its potability, making safe drinking water scarce. Addressing these issues requires analyzing water quality data and implementing targeted interventions to improve water treatment, mitigate health risks, and contribute to achieving SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
