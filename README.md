# Analyzing-water-quality-dataset
This project analyzes water quality data to assess parameters like pH, hardness, and conductivity, focusing on water potability and sustainable access. Using Kaggle data, it identifies contaminants and pollution trends. Then machine learning and visualization tools like Python and Power BI are used to enhance public awareness and support SDG 6.
